My first run to The Gap! Finally! Well, not really the first… I wheeled up the ‘The Unsurvivable’ alone one night when I was totally stock. I didn’t notice the bypass and didn’t feel like flopping the FJ over by myself in the dark with no recovery gear. So, I turned around. That was about ten months ago! A lot has changed since then and I was glad to be back…

It was a great run with lots of fairly ridiculous optional obstacles to play around on. I am crazy behind on writing these blog entries (more real life than internet? wha?!?!) so I will just briefly narrate a barrage of pics.

Big granite wall of doom thing…

This is how MEN cut sandwhiches (aka ‘this is not a sandwich for you,’ or ‘you need more SEAT TIME for this sandwich’)…
