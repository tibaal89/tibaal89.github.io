It was Friday night and I was supposed to be in NE of Phoenix the next morning. It seemed like there were two options: get up early and drive up there, or spend the night wheeling and camp on a trail somewhere along the way. Hmmm…. which sounds like more fun…

I decided to camp along Box Canyon in Florence. It’s a pretty easy trail that I know very well and camping is plentiful. Running it at night alone was sort of, well scary I guess. My HID’s are still off the truck so I had only the headlights to show the way. The light reflecting off the tall, narrow canyon walls and fading off both in the distance and vertically was a spooky. Then there’s that whole monsoon season flash flood thing…. I never did see the Boogie Man, though.
