I have two and a half days to make the 1,000-mile or so trek from Winnipeg to meet Lance in Cranbrook, BC. The plan is to blast across Canada on the Trans-Canada highway, giving my enough time to head north of Cranbrook aways and visit Banff and Jasper National Park. So far so good, I don’t meet Lance until tomorrow evening and am only about 6 hours from Calgary.

Nothing really notable happened on the way, except for this…. I’ve been making fun of the name of this town since I was very young. And now, finally, I have been there. My life is complete.
