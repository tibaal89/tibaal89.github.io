I met Jake and Becca and Dan (Sonic) for a fairly impromptu weekday night run of Chiva Falls in Tucson. Chiva is one of the best known trails near Tucson and features a very cool, large, and multifaceted obstacle called Three Feathers. On Three Feathers there are four main lines. Looking up at the obstacle from the bottom, there is the far left rocky crack thing, the easy bypass in the center-left, the huge depression thing in the center, and the chute on the right. The chute is dangerous because a slip of the tire would pretty well screw up your vehicle if you fell into the it… I’ve long talked about wanting to do the chute and the left side and this night was the perfect opportunity. So, as with any obstacle of this magnitude, we spent a lot of time looking at it and talking about the plan of attack before committing.

With that out of the way, it was time to get it on….

With that out of the way, I head over to the left side…

Having conquered the most difficult spots on the trail, Jake and I celebrated with a hearty chug of water.

I’m pretty proud of this poser-shot… stock springs (very light) with no sway bar = major flex.
