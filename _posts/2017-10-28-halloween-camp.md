I rode out to an [AZFJ Halloween pot luck](http://azfj.org/index.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=12586) and camped the night with some FJ folks I haven't seen in a long time. Originally I declined doing a Box Canyon run with a bunch of trucks because it's an easy trail for them and would be insanely challenging for me. Being in the area, I thought I'd at least explore near the trail. Like the famous Price Road rail bridge photo-op spot...

Where the sand is deep, the way is not straight...

I sort of just kept going and ended up in Box Canyon, oops. Did not go far, however. It was getting dark and up north by Mineral Mountain Road food awaited.

A welcome sight the next morning from my tent.

Parked by CeeFish and Bliss's tent-majal...

It was about the most beautiful possible night for camping, about 60F with clear starry skies. Thankfully I survived the night without uh, being affected by the previous nights eating festivities. :o
