I went for a longer version of the ride I took last Sunday since that was a lot of fun and on really nice roads. Again it went pretty well, though I’m not sure how much longer I could have kept it up… I was pretty damn wasted at the end of this one!

Good news is I completely blew through the hills that had me slowed up last time. I got the ‘end’ of that ride (Sunrise & Swan) much easier. That last hill near mile 19 pretty much kicked my ass, though, and it was slow from there out. Well, it was slow when I actually had to power the bike… most of it was fast downhill from that point.
