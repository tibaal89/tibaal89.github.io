We drove from Wilcox back to Phoenix via a dirt route and met our friend dizzyspots along the way. There was a return party scheduled in Gilbert at [SDHQ](www.sdhqoffroad.com). They do all kinds of stuff from sales and basic installations to high end custom work. A few FJ’s have gone through there and their work is obviously extremely good. What’s cool is that the owner, Ryan, opened up the place on his off day (Sunday) just for our party! Woohoo!

My birthday was a few days before and I was surprised with a super awesome cake of an FJ driving over a mountain or something. Here I am treating the cake FJ in the manner I do my own…
