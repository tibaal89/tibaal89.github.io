[AZNC 8/4/17 - Rever](https://a.rever.co/embed/rides/602782)

AZNC... AZ NC... AZ to NC, see what I did there?

Got a head start ahead of tomorrow's planned start of the trip. This was my first time out on the highway after installing a steering damper a couple days ago, holy crap what a difference. Very glad I freaked out and did that at the last second.

Temps were cool, rain was avoided - so far so good. Long day tomorrow.
