Susan and I packed up the bikes (we’re not cool enough to bike to where we want to bike yet) and drove over to Saguaro National Park East to ride the scenic Cactus Forest Loop Drive, known to locals as the ‘East Loop.’ The ride has an interesting profile. It’s about eight miles, almost all of which are downhill save for a massive one-mile hill climb in the middle. It was a blast! 

I’m a bit… uhm.. larger than most people pictured in such situations.

Susan looks much better pulling off the bicycling look.  ;)

It was my first time out on a ride other than going back and forth to school on the new UBER BIKE!

This was sort of interesting to see right next to where we stopped for a drink…
