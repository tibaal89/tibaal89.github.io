I spent the day in the FJ doing a quick pre-run of some dirt routes for an upcoming bike tour with Steve of There and Back Bikes. In March he plans on leading a tour leaving Tucson, looping around the Santa Ritas (crossing them by dirt), and hitting Patagonia, Sonoita, and Elgin before returning.

The results of the dirt recon were discouraging… much of route which is ideal by map is basically unrideable. But, the purpose of the drive was to have a good time and learn about the route – done and done. My tires didn’t blow up and we had only one encounter with a gun-toting rancher (actually a nice guy), all in all a good day. Oh, and I lost my Losbetos virginity to a sweet, sweet breakfast burrito…

This area surrounding this ridiculously huge tree would have made an epic place to camp…

The sign read “EJ’s Summerhome.”
