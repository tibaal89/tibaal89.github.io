Susan’s parents house is in Green Valley about 35 miles from my apartment along a nice road… perfect! Or so I thought, the weather had other ideas. I didn’t last very long riding head first into 35mph winds… longer than I thought, but Green Valley was not going to happen. The way back was fun though, with the wind and slightly negative grade allowing me to effortlessly ride around 25mph.

Distance: 45.1 miles  
Time: 3:14:30  
Avg. Speed: 13.9 mph
