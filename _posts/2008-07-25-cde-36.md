The day I dreaded was drawing closer and closer – soon the trip would be over. We were to cross into Arizona today, a symbolic end to our journey. Because of problems with gated ranchlands near the border, we were on pavement for much of the day. We passed this HUGE mine… here you can see one of those dump trucks that are the size of a house.

One other interesting thing was a piece of property along the highway which had a bunch of overturned cars on it… how odd!

We went to the familiar Rustler Park Campground and set up for the night. Being back in Arizona was bittersweet…
