Because we’d be in Phoenix to see the musical RENT and visit her relatives, Susan and I brought our bikes up and planned to ride someplace in Fountain Hills. I search mapmyride.com for local rides and after ruling out the so-called “tour of pain” decided on a nice route that would take us out of town into some nice rolling hills and nice scenery.

It was a blast! We’ve both come a long way… at the end of the ride I felt great and we easily could have turned around and done it again. The route was in fact very nice.

Distance: 22.8 miles  
Time: 1:32:05  
Avg. Speed: 13.2 mph
