[AZNC 8/13/17 - Rever](https://a.rever.co/embed/rides/617351)

It was important to me that I visit the ocean on this trip. Being so close compared to Arizona it seemed ridiculous not to spend the extra few hours plus I'd [visited the other ocean]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-20-san-diego-i %}) in preparation for this. Once there, I wandered around checking out a carnival, houses on stilts, and definitely people before finding this cool spot for a picture. Success!

My original plan was to check out the area pictured below, a beach you can drive on near Carolina Beach, NC. I wasn't sure if it would be a great idea to take a motorcycle out and once I saw it that was definitely a big nope. Here my bike is right at the end of a boardwalk before the soft stuff started.
