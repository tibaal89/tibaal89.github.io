Highway, highway, highway… boooooring… Not much else to say. There was a ’scenic’ view sign off the highway pictured below. Maybe I’m just jaded after all that Utah/Yellowstone/etc. stuff…

I stopped at the Cabelas in Grand Forks to pick up some rain gear for the fishing trip, the Continental Divide trip, and just to have for the future…. luckily there was a mad sale on!

Trying to get to the store, however, I was attacked and mauled by the most random and bizarre arrangement of wildlife on the streets of Grand Forks. I had to fight my way out with my hick-knife!
