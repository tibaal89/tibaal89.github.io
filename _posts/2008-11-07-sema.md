This is the engine in my FJ (minus the supercharger of course)… had never seen one quite so well before.

This was pretty funny… most gigantic drop-bracket IFS pickup lifts are show-off only crap, and no exception here. Not really sure what that little linkage thing is there, but it’s probably sort of important to be hanging out like that!

One display had this flipped over Jeep…

On the skid plates there were trail names with arrows pointing to dings and dents… one was Crown King! Crown King is a lot of fun, but I’m not sure it’s quite up to ‘signing your skids’ level… but that’s OK.

In the back of an Escalade EXT… an awesome setup, but I definitely prefer Guitar Hero.
