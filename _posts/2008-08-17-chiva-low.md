There are few trails called Chiva (also Chivo) Falls and this time out we ran the ‘lower loop’ which circles far to the south. On the USGS topo maps there is a trail that continues West and leads back to Tucson, but unfortunately it blocked with massive objects and very obvious signs.

As I am still crazy behind on updating my blog, I will again sort of barf a bunch of pictures at you with brief descriptive phrases. ;)

Flex shots…

Not too deep for Dan the Man from Tuscon! I followed…

The next cool spot was a little rock garden…

The real highlight of the day was back at the gas station airing up where I displayed my prowess with the manual transmission, driving about 100 feet and even shifting into 2nd gear!!
