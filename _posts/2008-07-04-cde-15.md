A huge thanks goes to [Woodhaven Toyota of Winnipeg](http://www.woodhaventoyota.ca/) for storing my FJ free of charge at the dealership while I was gone on my fishing trip. Secure storage of my truck and all my gear was a very important logistical concern and Myk Shane of Woodhaven came through big time for me, even moving the truck indoors at night in the service bay.

Helping me out like this was really impressive since the dealership is literally in a different country and they really stand nothing to gain by doing this for me. Myk and others at the dealership were very enthusiastic and interested in stories about the FJ and how it came to look the way it does. All in all a great experience!

After the time I had there as a random dude from 2,000 miles away, imagine how they must treat their legitimate customers!
