I broke about half the teeth off the 16T of my [cheap crappy cassette](http://www.performancebike.com/bikes/Product_10052_10551_1031981_-1___). I knew it would break eventually and horribly, but 200 miles of commuting on flat ground? Ouch.

It was a tragic end to the honeymoon of my enjoying a new chain on the Motobecane. Although, now I have a new chain and cassette to enjoy – yummy.
