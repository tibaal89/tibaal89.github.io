The personal blog of Mike McCambridge aka tibaal89. The origin of that name dates back to highschool and has something to do with pagan gods and graphing calculators. No, I was not born in 1989.

Check out my InfoSec blog at {% include icon-github.html username="n0j" %} / [n0j.github.io](https://n0j.github.io).

This site is made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) using the default minima theme plus some ideas from Lagom.  Everything Jekyll-related is a rough work in progress, as you may have noticed.
