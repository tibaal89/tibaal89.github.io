The personal blog of Mike McCambridge aka tibaal89. The origin of that name dates back to highschool and has something to with pagan gods and graphing calculators. No, I was not born in 1989.

This site is built in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the {% include icon-github.html username="jekyll" %} / [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. Everything Jekyll-related is a rough work in progress, as you may have noticed.
